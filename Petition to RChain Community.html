<p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>here are the latest critical developments of the RChain community<br>
1) #100 Community Debrief <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLY23ank9yE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLY23ank9yE</a><br>
2) Annual Membership Gathering <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdLp1lHThRI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdLp1lHThRI</a></p>
<p>Those developments pushed us as RChain coop members to take responsibility and step up to request a special meeting for the “Removal of Lucius Gregory Meredith as board member and as president” to start the process of reestablishing trust in the leadership of the RChain coop. Unfortunately we see a strong founders syndrome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_syndrome" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_syndrome</a> which is risking the success of the RChain coop.</p>
<p>Removal can only be justified with charges. Following list of (yet) unverified charges has surfaced (Link: Charges <a href="https://pastebin.com/3YDj1VQa" rel="nofollow">https://pastebin.com/3YDj1VQa</a>). The most severe charges are mismanagement of funds. Namely investments in projects which have little or nothing to do with the direct purpose described in the cooperative bylaws and/or described in the rchain private token sale offering (<a href="https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/RChain_Private_Token_Sale_August_2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/RChain_Private_Token_Sale_August_2017.pdf</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>Line 24: Routine and regular deception of the membership by both misstatement and by omission with regards to the terms of various business deals, various interested parties, and other matters. Including but not limited to misstatement and omission of the terms of the Immersion deal, the validator sale, the Pithia deal, and others.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As no tools were provided in the past to coordinate the community independently we created a separate channel for coordination outside of the discord server for the community to join and coordinate:<br>
<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/rchain-specialmeeting/shared_invite/enQtNDY0MTg2ODEyNzczLWVkYTBhM2IyYTIyOTA5ZDNjYzg5MWY1MTRmYzgzZmVlZjFhMTI5NWIwNDdhYTRlYjlkZGMzNmFhNjk2Njc3NTE" rel="nofollow">https://join.slack.com/t/rchain-specialmeeting/shared_invite/enQtNDY0MTg2ODEyNzczLWVkYTBhM2IyYTIyOTA5ZDNjYzg5MWY1MTRmYzgzZmVlZjFhMTI5NWIwNDdhYTRlYjlkZGMzNmFhNjk2Njc3NTE</a></p>
<p>The process how to remove Lucius Gregory Meredith as the RChain president and as a member of the board of directors is described in the bylaws of the RChain coop <a href="https://github.com/rchain/board/blob/master/2018/04-03/Exhibit_B_-_Bylaws_4-3-2018.docx.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/rchain/board/blob/master/2018/04-03/Exhibit_B_-_Bylaws_4-3-2018.docx.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>11. Removal Whenever any Director shall fail to meet the qualifications described in Section 2 of this Article, or fails to attend four (4) consecutive board meetings, either regular or special, without just cause, and provided that notice of such meetings has been properly given in accordance with these Bylaws, then it shall be the duty of the RChain Board to remove said director and to fill the vacancy in accordance with Section 9 of this Article. Any member may bring charges against an Officer or Director by filing charges in writing with the Secretary, together with a petition signed by at least ten percent (10%) of the members requesting the removal of the Officer or Director in question. Upon receipt of a petition signed by the membership, the removal shall be an item of business at the next regular or special meeting of the association. The director[s] whose removal is sought shall not vote in his or her removal. Upon an affirmative vote of no less than fiftyone percent (51%) of the active members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present, the Officer or Director shall be removed, and the RChain Board shall fill the vacancy, either by appointing a new Officer or with a temporary Director until the next election. In advance of the regular or special meeting the Director or Officer against whom such charges have been brought shall be informed in writing of the charges prior to the meeting and shall have an opportunity at the meeting to be heard in person or by counsel and to present witnesses. The person or persons bringing the charges shall have the same opportunity.</p></blockquote>

<p>We highly acknowledge Greg’s achievements, without him we would not have the gift of the rho-calculus. This achievement is untouched from this request to step down.<br>
It’s time for all involved parties to fill that gap which will be created by Greg’s leave and to step up to do the best we can to ensure the continuous development of the RChain network.</p>
<p>The community found it’s voice today.<br>
Let it be heard!</p>
